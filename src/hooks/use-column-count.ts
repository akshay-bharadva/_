/**
 * Number of masonry columns at the current viewport width.
 *
 * Masonry has no pure-CSS form that also preserves reading order. CSS
 * multi-column packs tightly but fills a whole column before starting the next,
 * so a newest-first feed reads down the entire left column before reaching the
 * second item. CSS Grid reads correctly but leaves a gap under every card
 * shorter than the tallest one in its row. Getting both means distributing the
 * items into columns ourselves, which means knowing how many there are.
 *
 * The breakpoints mirror the Tailwind `sm` / `lg` defaults used by the
 * consuming layout. They are declared here so the two cannot drift apart
 * silently — if a caller changes its grid classes it must change these too.

 * again. Round-robin puts item 0 at the top of column 0, item 1 at the top of
 * column 1, and so on, so scanning across the top row gives the newest items in
 * order and each column stays chronological downward.
 *
 * Empty columns are preserved so the flex row keeps even widths when there are
 * fewer items than columns.
