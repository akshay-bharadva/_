 * What a navigation href actually resolves to on the public site.

 * The navigation table is not just a menu. `(public)/[...slug]` builds one
 * prerendered page per *visible* nav link whose first segment is not reserved,
 * so for those paths the link is the only thing that makes the page exist. For
 * a reserved path the page comes from a route file instead and the link is
 * purely a menu entry. Three reserved segments have no route file at all.
 *
 * The owner cannot tell these apart from the href, and the consequences differ
 * sharply — so this is derived once, here, rather than guessed per call site.
