/**
 * The lead, in place of four stat cards.
 *
 * The previous header was four equal-weight numbers — done today, longest
 * streak, 30-day average, active habits — which is the failure the dashboard
 * rebuild diagnosed: equal weight makes the reader do the triage the screen
 * exists to do. "Active habits: 5" in particular is a number that has never
 * once required a decision.
 *
 * This says one thing, then shows what is on the line. No points, levels or
 * badges: the XP card was removed from this module once already because its
 * score rewarded breadth over persistence, and nothing here is a number that
 * is not a plain fact about the habits.
