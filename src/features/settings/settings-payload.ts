 * The machinery behind per-group save.

 * time. That needs three things kept honest, and all three are pure functions
 * so they can be tested without a DOM:
 *
 *   - which fields belong to the group (`FieldPath[]`, from the registry),
 *   - what to write (`buildGroupPayload`) — the group's edits laid over the
 *     last known server state, so saving Footer never persists a half-finished
 *     Theme edit sitting in the same form,
 *   - what counts as an error for this group (`issuesForGroup`) — so an invalid
 *     GitHub username stops the GitHub group and nothing else. That was the
 *     old screen's worst behaviour: one resolver over one submit meant a bad
 *     value anywhere blocked every unrelated save.
