/**
 * Resolving a CMS page from the 404 route.
 *
 * **Why this exists at all.** `(public)/[...slug]` builds one prerendered page
 * per visible nav link, and `generateStaticParams` runs *at build time* with
 * `dynamicParams = false`. The navigation itself is fetched at *runtime*. So a
 * page created in the admin after the last deploy appears in the site's own
 * menu of a build that contains no HTML for it, and GitHub Pages answers with
 * `404.html`. That is not a bug in the route — it is what `output: "export"`
 * means, and no amount of extra route generation can fix it, because the page
 * did not exist when the build ran.
 *
 * GitHub Pages serves `404.html` for *any* unmatched path, which makes it the
 * one place a static export can still make a decision about a URL. So the 404
 * page asks this: does a visible nav link claim this path? If it does, the
 * same `CmsPage` renders and the visitor never sees a 404. The prerendered
 * route remains the fast path for everything that existed at build time; this
 * is the catch-up path for everything created since.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function, separate from the page, because the interesting
 * part is the matching rules and those are worth testing without a DOM.
