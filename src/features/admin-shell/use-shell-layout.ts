/**
 * Sidebar rail or app launcher, as the owner's choice.
 *
 * This project has argued itself round this loop twice — rail, then floating
 * pill bar with navigation behind a keystroke, then rail again, then launcher
 * — and each answer was defended as the correct one. That is usually a sign
 * there is no correct one: a rail is worth its 15rem on a wide monitor where
 * the space is free, and is a sixth of the screen on a laptop. Making it a
 * preference is the honest end of that argument.
 *
 * **Stored per device, in `localStorage`.** Deliberately not in the database:
 * the right answer genuinely differs between a 27-inch monitor and a 13-inch
 * laptop, and a synced setting would make choosing on one of them the wrong
 * choice on the other. It is also not site content — `site_identity` is
 * publicly readable, and how the owner arranges their own admin chrome is
 * nobody else's business.
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` currently states the shell has no rail. That was written when the
 * rail had been removed, and the rail came back anyway without the file being
 * updated — which is how the contradiction this pass found got there. With the
 * rail now a supported option, that line needs revising rather than quietly
 * contradicting the code again.
