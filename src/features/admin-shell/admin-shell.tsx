/**
 * The guarded Personal OS shell, in whichever arrangement the owner chose.
 *
 * **This project argued itself round the same loop three times** — rail, then a
 * floating pill bar with navigation behind a keystroke, then the rail again,
 * then the launcher — and defended each answer as the correct one. That is
 * usually the sign that there is no single correct one. A rail is worth its
 * 15rem on a wide monitor where the space is free and costs a sixth of the
 * screen on a laptop, so it is a preference now, stored per device.
 *
 * Both arrangements share `NAV_GROUPS` and `isActiveNavHref`, so they cannot
 * disagree about what exists or about which module you are in — which is the
 * failure that would make having two of them expensive.
 *
 * The launcher is the default, because it works at every width; the rail
 * assumes there is room for it. See `use-shell-layout.ts`.
