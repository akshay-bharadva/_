 * Prices for the watchlist, in two tiers.

 * entry has a live price and a 24-hour change today, with nothing to configure.
 *
 * **Equities need one, and it has to be yours.** No keyless, CORS-open source
 * for stock, ETF or index quotes exists — that was tested, not assumed; see
 * `watchlist.ts` for what was tried and what each one returned. Finnhub and
 * Twelve Data are both CORS-open and both have a free tier, so a key you own
 * makes those rows live.
 *
 * The key is stored on `integration_settings`, which has RLS and **no public
 * read policy at all**, and Discover is an admin route — so the owner's own
 * browser reads it and it never enters the bundle. That is the same argument
 * migration 007 made about the Discord webhook, and the reason a
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` key is not an option here.
 *
 * **Funds and bonds stay a link-out.** Neither free tier covers them, and a
 * row that silently shows nothing while its neighbours show prices reads as a
 * bug. `quotableKinds` says which is which, so the UI can be explicit.
