/**
 * Career discovery that is not one German job board.
 *
 * The module read a single source, Arbeitnow, which is a German board — so
 * "career" meant "roles in Germany", which is not much use from Ontario. This
 * adds Remote OK alongside it and gives the results the two axes that actually
 * decide whether a posting is worth reading: **where** and **on what terms**.
 *
 * ## Attribution is a requirement, not a courtesy
 *
 * Remote OK's API terms ask for a followed link back and a named credit, and
 * say access is suspended without it. `JOB_SOURCES` carries that so the UI
 * cannot render the results without also rendering the credit.
 *
 * ## The shape of the response is a trap
 *
 * Remote OK's array does not begin with a job. Element zero is a legal notice
 * — `{ legal: "API Terms of Service: …" }` — and a parser that maps straight
 * over the array produces a phantom posting with no title. The fixture in
 * `__fixtures__/remoteok.json` keeps that element on purpose, because a
 * hand-written fixture would not have it and the test would pass against a
 * parser that breaks on the real thing.
