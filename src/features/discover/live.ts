/**
 * Trending news and the job market — both reachable directly from a browser.
 *
 * This replaced a Supabase edge function, and the reason is worth recording.
 * The function existed as a CORS shim for Google News and Yahoo Finance, and
 * it worked, but it made two features depend on a deploy step that had to be
 * run and maintained. Both are now served by sources that send
 * `access-control-allow-origin: *` themselves, so the shim and its deploy step
 * are gone.
 *
 * **Trending** is Mastodon's trending-links endpoint: the news articles being
 * shared most across the network right now, with share counts. It is closer to
 * what "trending" actually means than a publisher's own front page, because
 * the ranking comes from readers rather than an editor.
 *
 * **Jobs** is Arbeitnow, which returns around 175 live postings in one
 * request. Remotive was tried first and dropped: its `search` parameter is
 * silently ignored — a query for "react" and a query for "data engineer"
 * return the identical seventeen jobs, headed by "Patient Care Specialist" —
 * so every result and every skill count derived from it was noise wearing the
 * shape of an answer.
