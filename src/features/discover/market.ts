/**
 * Money and markets, read from the browser without a key.

 * limits and sends no `access-control-allow-origin`, and Stooq's CSV is gone.
 * Everything else needs a key, which in a static export means publishing it.
 * So this covers currencies, crypto and published economic figures, and the UI
 * says plainly that indices are missing rather than substituting something
 * that looks like them.
 *
 * The currency panel is the one that earns its place. Someone earning in one

 * answers it far better than today's number alone.
