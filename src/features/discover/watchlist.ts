/**
 * A watchlist for instruments this app cannot quote.
 *
 * ## What was tested, and what it means
 *
 * Every other source in Discover is keyless and CORS-open, because a static
 * export has no server: a key would travel as `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` and be compiled
 * into the bundle. Quotes for stocks, ETFs and funds are the one thing with no
 * such source, and that was checked rather than assumed:
 *
 * | Source           | Result                                                    |
 * | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | Yahoo Finance    | 429 on the first request; unofficial endpoint             |
 * | Stooq CSV        | 404 on its documented shapes, and sends no CORS headers   |
 * | marketdata.app   | answers for the single demo symbol `AAPL`, "No credentials provided" for everything else |
 * | Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, Twelve Data, Polygon, FMP | key required up front |
 *
 * CoinGecko (crypto) and Frankfurter (FX) *are* keyless and open, which is why
 * those two work today and equities do not.
 *
 * ## So the watchlist works in two modes, and says which
 *
 * **Without a key** it is a list you maintain: what you follow, what kind of
 * instrument it is, where it trades, and why you are watching it — with a link
 * out to a quote. That is genuinely useful and it is honest. No number is
 * invented to fill the space, which is the specific thing the brief ruled out.
 *
 * **With a key** — pasted into the admin, stored on `integration_settings`,
 * which has RLS and *no public read policy at all* — quotes appear. Discover is
 * an admin route, so the owner's own browser can read that row and the key
 * never enters the bundle. It is the same argument migration 007 made about the
 * Discord webhook.
