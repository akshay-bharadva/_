/**
 * Finding an instrument by name, so nobody has to know its ticker.
 *
 * Typing a raw symbol and an exchange code is a bad ask — most people know
 * "Shopify", not that it is `SHOP` on NASDAQ *and* `SHOP` on the TSX at
 * different prices in different currencies. That ambiguity is exactly why the
 * watchlist has an exchange field, and exactly why the field cannot reasonably
 * be filled by hand.
 *
 * Both search endpoints are **keyless and CORS-open**, which was tested:
 *
 * - **Twelve Data `symbol_search`** answers without a token, unlike its quote
 *   endpoint. So searching works before any key is configured, even though
 *   pricing does not — the shape of the whole module.
 * - **CoinGecko `search`** covers coins.
 *
 * A result carries the venue and currency with it, so choosing one fills in
 * everything the entry needs and the exchange is never typed.
