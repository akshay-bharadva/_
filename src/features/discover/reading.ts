/**
 * "What is most worth reading right now?"

 * not publish one — Substack in particular has no public API for likes or
 * shares, so the "30k likes" shape of request cannot be served from it
 * honestly. Two sources do publish real numbers, and both are keyless and
 * CORS-open:
 *
 * - **Hacker News** — `score` (upvotes) and `descendants` (comments).
 * - **dev.to** — `positive_reactions_count` and `comments_count`, with a
 *   `top=N` parameter that means "most reacted in the last N days".
 *
 * Nothing here invents a number. An article with no signal is not given a
 * plausible one; it is not ranked at all.
