/**
 * The active entry, given where each heading currently sits in the viewport.
 *
 * **What this replaces.** The active heading came from an
 * `IntersectionObserver` with `rootMargin: "-20% 0px -70% 0px"` that set the
 * active id only `if (entry.isIntersecting)` — that is, only while a heading
 * was inside a band 20%–30% of the way down the viewport. Three failures came
 * out of that, and the owner reported two of them:
 *
 *  1. **Clicking an entry could never highlight it.** The click parks the
 *     heading 96px from the top. On a 900px window the band starts at 180px.
 *     The heading lands *above* the band, never intersects, and the highlight
 *     stays wherever it was. This is why the page scrolled to the right place
 *     and the wrong entry stayed lit.
 *  2. **The last heading was often unreachable.** At the end of the document
 *     there may be no scroll left to bring a short final section up into the
 *     band, so its entry never lit at all.
 *  3. **Several entries in one callback resolved by array order.** The last
 *     one in the array won regardless of which was actually on screen, so a
 *     fast scroll could leave a lower heading active than the one being read.
 *
 * Asking "which heading did I last pass" instead has none of those states: it
 * is defined for every scroll position, it uses the same line the click does,
 * and exactly one entry is always active.
 *
 * `tops` are viewport-relative (`getBoundingClientRect().top`).
