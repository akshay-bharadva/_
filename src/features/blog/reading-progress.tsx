 * Progress through the article, shown as a bar under the sticky header.
 *
 * Two things were wrong with measuring `document.documentElement.scrollHeight`:
 *
 * 1. It measured the whole document, so the header, breadcrumb, footer and
 *    share row all counted as "article". The bar reached 100% well after the
 *    post had ended, and started above 0% on a short post.
 *
 * 2. It was computed once on mount and then only on scroll. The markdown
 *    pipeline is code-split and lands *after* mount, so the initial reading was
 *    taken against a page that did not yet contain the post — and if the reader
 *    never scrolled, it was never corrected. A ResizeObserver recomputes when
 *    the article's height actually changes, which covers the chunk arriving and
 *    images resolving.
