/**
 * The day as one continuous thing, rather than a grid of modules.
 *
 * Every dashboard I replaced here was a set of panels — one per module, each
 * answering "how is Tasks", "how is Finance". But nobody opens their own tools
 * asking about a module. They ask *what is my day*, and the answer is a shape
 * in time: what has gone, what is happening now, what is still ahead.
 *
 * So the hero is a spine. Hours run down it, the current moment is a line
 * across it, and everything the app knows about today is docked at the hour it
 * belongs to. Events have real times. Habits have a time of day. Tasks due
 * today have neither, so they sit in a dock rather than being invented a slot
 * — a task pinned to 09:00 because something had to go somewhere is the exact
 * lie the old calendar told, and it is recorded in the log as a trap.
 *
 * All of it is pure. The interesting parts are arithmetic — which hours to
 * show, where an event sits, what counts as "next" — and arithmetic is
 * testable in a way that a positioned div is not.
