/**
 * What each lockdown level actually does.
 *
 * This module exists because the previous descriptions were not true. Level 2
 * was labelled "API Read-Only. No edits allowed." and nothing enforced it:
 * `lockdown_level` appears in the schema exactly twice — the column definition
 * and a seed row — and no RLS policy references it. Setting level 2 changed a
 * message on the public site and nothing else, so the owner could believe
 * writes were blocked while they were not.
 *
 * A security screen that overstates what it does is worse than one that does
 * less, so the copy here describes the enforcement that exists. Where a level
 * depends on a migration the owner may not have run, it says so.
