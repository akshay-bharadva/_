/**
 * Dragging assets between folders.
 *
 * Two different drags land on the same page and must never be confused:
 *
 *  - **Files from the desktop**, which upload into the current folder.
 *  - **Assets already in the library**, which move.
 *
 * The browser tells them apart through `dataTransfer.types`: an OS file drag
 * carries `"Files"`, and an in-app drag carries whatever type the drag source
 * set. Guarding on that is not cosmetic — without it, dragging an asset over
 * the grid raises the "drop to upload" overlay over a gesture that is not an
 * upload, and dropping it there runs the upload handler with no files.
 *
 * Follows `calendar/drag-move.ts`: a distinct MIME type, an encoder, and a
 * decoder that assumes nothing about what it is handed, because `dataTransfer`
 * carries whatever the page it came from put there — including a drag that
 * started outside the app.
