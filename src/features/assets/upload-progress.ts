/**
 * Uploading with a progress figure, which the SDK cannot give.
 *
 * `supabase-js` v2 uploads through `fetch`, and `fetch` has no upload-progress
 * event — the Streams-based request body that would allow one is not supported
 * for uploads in any shipping browser. So a 40 MB video through the SDK is a
 * spinner and nothing else, which is what was reported.
 *
 * `XMLHttpRequest` does have `upload.onprogress`, and Storage's REST endpoint
 * is the same one the SDK posts to. This is therefore *not* a workaround
 * around the SDK's rules — same URL, same bucket, same auth — only a different
 * transport for the one request whose progress matters.
 *
 * The trade is explicit: this hand-rolls what the SDK does for us, so it has
 * to reproduce the auth header and the error shape itself. `uploadFile` below
 * falls back to the SDK when anything about the XHR path is unavailable, so a
 * missing session or a blocked XHR costs the progress bar rather than the
 * upload.
