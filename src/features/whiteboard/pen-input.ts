 * Pen and touch handling for the drawing surface.

 * Excalidraw draws from pointer events and does not distinguish a stylus from
 * the hand resting beside it, so on a tablet the palm lands first, registers as
 * a touch pointer, and draws a stray stroke before the nib is down. Every
 * drawing app that is usable with a pen solves this the same way: once a stylus
 * has been seen, single-finger touch stops drawing and is reserved for
 * navigation.
 *
 * The decisions live here as pure functions so they can be tested without a
 * digitiser — the bug they prevent is impossible to reproduce with a mouse.
