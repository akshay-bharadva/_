 * Which days a view shows, and which range it has to fetch.
 *
 * Pulled out of the page's `useMemo` because it is the one piece of calendar
 * logic that every other part depends on and none of it is about React: the
 * grid draws `days`, the RPC is called with `from`/`to`, `buildEntries` filters
 * on the same window, and the heading names its ends. When those disagree, rows
 * are fetched and not drawn — or drawn and not fetched — which is the shape of
 * every "why is this missing" bug this module has had.
 *
 * It is also where the responsive week lives. A week is seven days on a screen
 * with room for seven; below `md` it was still seven inside an `overflow-hidden`
 * grid, about 50px a day on a phone — narrower than the time labels in it.
