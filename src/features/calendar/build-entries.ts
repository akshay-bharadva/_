 *
 * Every view then buckets by `startOfDay()`, which is **local**. West of UTC

 * edge, where the shift pushes the row outside the window and it is not drawn
 * at all — which is what "some things just don't load" turns out to be.
 *
 * Events are deliberately *not* in this set. An all-day event is written by
 * the sheet as `new Date(localInput).toISOString()`, so its instant already
 * carries the author's local date; reading it as UTC would break the kind that
