/**
 * What the sheet shows for a task, a habit roll-up or a day's money.
 *
 * These three are rendered on the calendar but owned by their own modules, so
 * the sheet is read-only for them. That was taken too literally: it showed the
 * date and nothing else, which is the one fact the grid had already told you.
 * Opening a habit summary should say *which* habits, and opening a day's money
 * should say how much moved.
 *
 * The database already returns all of it — `get_calendar_data` builds a JSON
 * payload per row — so this is purely a matter of reading what was sent. The
 * blob is unconstrained JSONB, so every field is validated on the way out
 * rather than trusted: a missing key means the row predates the column, not
 * that the caller may render `undefined`.
