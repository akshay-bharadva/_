/**
 * Which colour an entry draws in.
 *
 * The per-entity fallback lives here rather than at each call site, because
 * five surfaces render entries — week, day, month, agenda and the all-day row —
 * and a colour decided independently in each is a colour that disagrees with
 * itself.
 *
 * The rule is: an event's own `color_token` wins if it has one, otherwise it
 * takes its calendar's. That is what makes the checkbox in the sidebar mean
 * something — tick "Work" green and the events on Work are green, without
 * having to set a colour on every one of them.
 *
 * Overlays keep their own identity. A task, a habit roll-up and a day's money
 * are not on any calendar, and colouring them like one would say they were.
