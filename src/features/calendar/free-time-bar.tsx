 * How much unbooked time is actually left.
 *
 * Outlook's idea, and the one number that makes "yes, I can take that on" an
 * informed answer rather than a guess. Counted only over the visible hours and
 * only over days that have not already passed — free time in the past is not a
 * resource, and including it would make every Friday look wide open.
 *
 * All-day items are excluded. A task due today does not consume an afternoon;
 * a block you created for it does, and that is a different row.
