/**
 * Spaced review scheduling.
 *
 * The module used to ask you to rate your own "confidence" from 1 to 5 and set
 * a status by hand. Self-rating is unreliable, it is one more form to fill in,
 * and — worst of all — nothing ever acted on it. A topic marked "Mastered" was
 * never seen again, so everything learned decayed silently.
 *
 * A review rating does three jobs at once: it is a single tap, it is a real
 * signal because it follows an attempt to recall, and it schedules the next
 * review. The tool answers "what should I study today?" instead of asking.
 *
 * `record_learning_review` in the database is authoritative — these functions
 * mirror it so the UI can say "next in 6 days" before you commit to the rating,
 * and so the arithmetic is testable without a round trip.
