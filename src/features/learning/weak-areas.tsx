 * What keeps slipping.
 *
 * `lapses` and `ease` have been recorded since the module's first migration
 * and never shown anywhere, so the one question a study tool ought to be able
 * to answer — "what am I actually bad at?" — had no screen. Both are already
 * honest signals rather than invented scores: a lapse is a topic you had
 * learned and then failed to recall, and ease falls each time that happens.
 *
 * Deliberately short. A list of everything you are weak at is a list nobody
 * opens twice, and the point is to pick something up, not to be audited.
