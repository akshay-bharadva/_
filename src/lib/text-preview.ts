/**
 * The first line of a markdown body, with its markup taken off.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in a feature because two of them need it — Notes and
 * Life updates both have an optional title and both were writing "Untitled"
 * over content that already said what it was. A feature reaching into another
 * feature's internals is what the architecture forbids, and this is
 * domain-independent text handling.
 *
 * The raw first line is as likely to be `## Heading` or `- [ ] thing` as it is
 * prose, so leading syntax is stripped rather than the whole line skipped:
 * `# Groceries` should read "Groceries", not fall through to the second line.
