/**
 * Fill in a `site_identity` row so the rest of the app can trust its shape.
 *
 * `profile_data`, `social_links` and `footer_data` are nullable JSONB columns.
 * Nothing in Postgres constrains what is inside them, but `SiteContent` types
 * every nested key as required — so the hero read
 * `profile_data.status_panel.availability` three levels deep with no guard. A
 * row written before a key existed, hand-edited in the SQL editor, or produced
 * by a partial settings save takes down the **public homepage** for every
 * visitor, not just the owner.
 *
 * Normalising once at the data boundary is preferable to optional chaining
 * scattered through the renderers: the components keep their honest types, and
 * there is a single place that decides what "missing" means.
 *
 * This is used by `publicApi.getSiteIdentity` **and** by the settings form. It
 * used not to be: the settings page carried its own sixty-line `nullsToStrings`
 * + merge + pad block inside a `useEffect`, so the same question had two
 * answers, only one of which had a test behind it. The form now loads through
 * here, and the differences that block relied on (padding arrays to a fixed
 * number of inputs) are gone with the fixed-slot inputs that needed them.
 *
 * Deliberately Zod-free. `publicApi` is on every route, so pulling the schema
 * module in here would put Zod in every public page's first load.

 * In every case the default's leaf wins, so the result matches the shape of

 * Arrays are taken wholesale rather than merged element-wise — a stored list of
