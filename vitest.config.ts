      Vitest defaults to 5s per test, which is generous for a unit test and
      tight for the integration ones: `settings-page.test.tsx` renders the whole
      settings page — a large form plus a live preview of the real site header
      and footer — nineteen times, and the slowest case takes ~860ms on an idle
      machine. Run alone the file passes in about six seconds; run inside the
      full suite, with every worker competing for the same cores, individual
      tests stretch past five and fail on the clock rather than on a claim.

      That failed three times during one session — twice as a timeout, once
      failing to collect the file at all — and passed alone and on re-run every
      time. A test that fails only when the machine is busy teaches people to
      re-run CI without reading it, which is worse than a slow suite.

      Fifteen seconds is still far short of a genuine hang: a test waiting on
      something that never resolves fails here, just later and unambiguously.
